Editor.js
a web-based video editor in JavaScript.
Requires Firefox 3.5+ with Firefogg extension (http://firefogg.org).

How to encode a video for the web?
1. Select a local video file clicking on "Open video file" button.
2. A low quality preview video is generated.
3. Edit the video/audio settings. Default values are retrieved from source file.
4. When adjusting crop borders, width and height a preview is updated.
5. When you're done click on "Encode file to..." and generated a video file.
6. When you're done, remember to delete the preview video created in the same folder as your source.

Limitations:
It is not yet possible to use directly a web ready video.
It is still beta and a whole bunch of things needs refactoring/improvments...

Editor.js used HTML5 features (Video, Canvas, File API).
